    <h1>The fourd.js Library</h1>
    <p>The fourd.js library allows web developers to dynamically visualize graphs in 3D.</p>
    <p>Seven years in the making, this project is inspired by Todd Veldhuizen's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1549">Dynamic Multilevel Graph Visualization</a> and <a href="http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/">Ubigraph</a>. This library is written in javascript using <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/">mrdoob</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">three.js. Thank You!</p>

    <h2>What do these words mean?</h2>
    <span class="definition">A <b>Graph</b> is a collection of vertices and edges. Think of a train network or phone and power lines. In the train network, the train stations are the vertices (singular: vertex, also called nodes), while the tracks the train travels on are the edges. The phone and power lines are the edges, the poles and buildings are vertices.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Dynamic</b> in this context means the vertices and edges don't have to be known upfront. You can add or remove them on the go. <br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Visualization</b> means you can look at it. Please make an effort to use or plan for the use of standardized formats such as <a href="http://www.data-vocabulary.org">www.data-vocabulary.org</a>. I can do better in this department myself.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>3D or FourD.</b> We agree to call a flat surface representing depth "3D" as long as its elements move. Add to that the dynamic property, and you get fourd.js.<br /></span>

    <h2>What can I do with it?</h2>
    <span>This is a library, it can be used to visualize graphs. With a little tweaking, you could use it for a collection of mathematical shapes. I intend to make data visualizations of society. You know how social media gives us contact lists? Why can't we have nice things?</span>
    
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <span>
      <h3>API</h3>
      <span>The API defined by fourd.js is quite simple.
      <pre>
var fourd = new FourD(); // instantiation
fourd.init('#selector', {width: 600, height: 350}); // initialization
 
 
var vertex_options = {
  width: 5, // pixels
  height: 5,
  depth: 5,
  color: 0x000000 // hex color
};
 
// or:

var vertex_options = {
  width: 5,
  height: 5,
  depth: 5,
  texture: 'path_to,png'
}
 
// or:
 
// leave out vertex options altogether.
// default values will be used.
 
 
var vertex1 = fourd.graph.add_vertex(vertex_options); // add a vertex
var vertex2 = fourd.graph.add_vertex(vertex_options); // add another vertex
 
var edge_options = {}; // currently not defined, but this is how you would pass them.
 
var edge = fourd.graph.add_edge(vertex1, vertex2, edge_options);
 
fourd.graph.remove_edge(edge); // this is why you keep those variables
fourd.graph.remove_vertex(vertex1);
fourd.graph.remove_vertex(vertex2);
      </pre>
      </span>
    </span>
    </span>
    
    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <span>Intended to run in the browser, it has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. Rumor has it that by switching to the CanvasRenderer, the library even works on a Raspberry PI. This is, of course, complete and utter nonsense, and when I catch those responsible ...</span><br /><br />
    
    <h2>Other questions</h2>
    <span><b>Can I have it?</b> Absolutely. The library is available on <a href="https://github.com/lowrekey/fourd.js">github.com</a> under the Apache 2.0 license. Contributions are welcome.</span><br /><br />
    
    <span><b>Will you display my work here?</b> Send me a link and I'll be happy to take a look at it. You can get a hold of me via <a href="mailto:lowrekey@gmail.com">email</a>.</span><br /><br />
    
    <span><b>What's today's date?</b> Gong... Today is Monday, April, the 27th, 2015</span><br /><br />
    
    <span><b>Credits</b>This library is a labor of love. It began in college and continued way past. It is not complete. But this milestone is a cause to celebrate. I want to thank the woman who got me into Computer Science in the first place (you know who you are), and my mother, who has supported me and endured endless rants on a topic completely foreign to her. Love you!</span><br /><br />
    
    <span><b>Citizen, what is your name?</b> Huh?</span>
